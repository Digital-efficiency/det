// This line of code re-exports all exports from the './color' module.
// It allows other modules to import everything that is exported from './color'
// without needing to directly import from that module. This is useful for 
// creating a single entry point for multiple exports, simplifying the import 
// statements in other parts of the application.

export * from './color';
